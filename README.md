# Grow Lapse Client

Grow lapse is an open source minimal system for taking and managing time lapses.  If you do not have the server setup follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/YieldTek/growlapse-server) to get the server up and running.

## Prerequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)

## Installation
Clone and enter the repository from your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/YieldTek/growlapse-client.git`

`cd growlapse-client`

Install project dependencies:

`npm install`

## Configuration
I suggest going in the growlapse-client/config/enviroment.js file and editing the SERVER_IP key.  Set the value to the IP address of the machine you are running the server on.  This will allow you to access and use the client from machines other than the one running it.

## Running / Development

* `ember serve`
* Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

## Running Tests

* `ember test`
* `ember test --server`
